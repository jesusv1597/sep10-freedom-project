                        <p class="lead">Fitness, to me, has always been something that came off as an activity that doesn't have much to do with technology. Which is why I decided to research some technologies that can help with ones fitness journey as taking care of your health and making sure to stay fit can be very difficult for some. So finding things that can help with that will always be a good thing.  </p>

                              <h5 class="card-title">MyFitnessPal</h5>
                              <p class="card-text">MyFitnessPal is an app and site that allows its users to track their calories, in terms of intake and to just track the calories within their foods. MyFitnessPal acts as a journal that you can use to log your entire fitness journey in. This is an imporant and very beneficial technology one can use within their fitness journey because dieting is an essential part of fitness. Weight loss/gain is likely the most difficult part of a fitness journey. But when you really look at it, dieting is really all about the calories you intake, so having a way to track these calories makes dieting far easier. And with something as difficult as dieting, any sort of help makes a huge difference.</p>

                                  <h5 class="card-title">Fitbit</h5>
                                  <p class="card-text">The Fitbit is a wearable piece of hardware that allows for its users to do many things, some similar to MyFitnessPal and some different. Whilst MyFitnessPal can serve as your digital journal for dieting, the Fitbit can serve as a tracker for your actual exercise. The Fitbit is able to accurately track calories burned throughout the duration of a workout or throughout your day, as well as being able to accurately track the amount of steps taken throughout one's day. These features are important because being healthy isn't just about tracking calories and losing weight, it's also about your day to day physical activities. Physical acitivies like cardiovascular exercise and weight training have all been proven to be beneficial to a person's mental and physical health, so something like a fitbit can help ensure that you're consistent with the amount of times you do physical activities. </small></p>

                        <p>
                            The future for technology is bright as there are so many new discoveries found and studies run every year as the human body and one's health is something that will always be studied on no matter what. After brainstorming some possible technologies that could be created in the future, I finally came up with a product that checks off all the boxes that I believe are needed in order to help someone along their fitness journey the most.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="future">
                        <p> I believe that a mixture of the "MyFitnessPal" app and of the "Fitbit" would be extremely beneficial, my product would be an advanced smart watch with the ability to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Accurately track ones calories burned throughout the day using things like heartbeat and workout statistics</li>
                            <li> Serve as a log for the user to track their weight and workouts, as well as tracking things like steps and other day to day physical activities</li>
                            <li> Give accurate estimates of the calories within a variety of foods in order to help keep track of calories consumed
                                  </li>
                            <li> Use an AI fitness advisor that gives you ideas and suggestions as to how you should go about doing workouts and dieting</li>
                            <li> Give a library of videos and articles that demonstrate how to do workouts, as well as which muscle groups the workouts target</li>
                            <li> Track the user's sleep</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p> This device would have the technology of the Fitbit and of MyFitnessPal inside of it, meaning it would offer the same services as both of them. All inside one tiny smart watch</p>
