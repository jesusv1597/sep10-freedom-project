### What would be considered as Health and Fitness?

My topic could have many parts to it, for example. Health on its own could have many parts to it, there's mental health, physical health, emotional health, and a lot more. But I am going to focus more on the physical aspects of both health and fitness. A good article to introduce someone to these aspect is the Web MD article [Exercise and Weight loss] (https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/exercise-weight-control)
