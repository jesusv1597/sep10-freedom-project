### What would be considered as Health and Fitness?

My topic could have many parts to it, for example. Health on its own could have many parts to it, there's mental health, physical health, emotional health, and a lot more. But I am going to focus more on the physical aspects of both health and fitness. Some good articles to introduce someone to these fitness aspects are the Web MD article ["Exercise and Weight Loss"](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/exercise-weight-control), as well as the American Heart Association article ["Why is physical activity so important for health and well-being?"](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/why-is-physical-activity-so-important-for-health-and-wellbeing)

## Software 

I spent a couple days researching some pieces of software that are related to health/fitness and these are some that I found that are really innovative and beneficial to the field.

### [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com)

The first piece of software I found that intrigued me is an app called **_MyFitnessPal_**. I read the information given within the [MyFitnessPal support section](https://support.myfitnesspal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032626011-How-does-MyFitnessPal-work-) and figured out that MyFitnessPal is an app that allows its user to do many things, a lot of these things being very beneficial when it comes to working out and being healthy. MyFitnessPal is mostly known for its ability to log user's food intake and to give its users accurate nutritional facts about food, these are all health aspects but this app also has features that help with a user's fitness journey. The app also works as a journal for things like weight and strength progression so users can have a virtual place to log their journey. 

### [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app)

I dug a little deeper and found a site that provided information for the [Nike Training Club App](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app)  The Nike Training Club app is an app that is fairly similar to MyFItnessPal but with a few added features. the Nike Training Club App focuses on the training aspect of fitness and is really useful for finding workout suited to you. One of these features is the ability to connect with trainers online, these trainers are professionals at what they can guide you throughout your entire fitness journey. The Trainers not only provide advice for working out, they also provide advice when it comes to nutrition as well, meaning you can have entire workout plans and meal plans made specifically for you.

## Hardware

I then dug into the hardware aspect of fitness/health. Hardware was a pretty difficult thing to determine but I eventually realized that things like personal trainers and gyms counted, so I am going to use personal trainers and fitbits as examples of fitness hardware. 

### Fitbits 

The very first thing that came to my mind when I thought of fitness hardware was the _**Fitbit**_. The Fitbit is a pretty popular piece of hardware when it comes to namability, but not many people actually use them too often. Though Fitbits are not necessary for your fitness journey they can actually be a pretty big help. Fitbits are wristwatches that have the ability to accurately count the amount of calories you've burned and the amount of steps you've taken, there are many phone apps that can do this this but the difference between them and the fitbits is that fitbits are wearables and go directly on your wrist, meaning they are a lot more accurate than smartphones. 

### Personal Trainers

Personal trainers are a fairly well known concept when it comes to fitness but they are once again not used as much as other concepts. And though I understand that they could be pretty pricey at times, they could be really beneficial for people who need someone to motivate them and to give them the plans they need in order to reach their fitness goal. I first looked up "Fitness trainers" on google and spotted plenty of articles talking about where you could find fitness trainers near you. I then looked further and found a site called [FitnessTrainer.com](https://fitnesstrainer.com/) this site allows you to search for fitness trainers in your area and lets you get in touch with them in order to hire them to assist you along your fitness journey.

## EDP (Engineering Design Process)

I am currently at the **_Brainstorm_** section of my freedom project as I have already defined my problem and researched technology that has to do with my topic. And now I have to take some time to think of possible future technologies that will be very impactful to the field of *Fitness/Health*.

## Skills

This blog took a lot more research than my previous one because I had to spend a couple of days looking through technologies that have to do with my field. Though this may have been a pretty long and tedious search process, it actually taught me more about googling and using google to find out information technologies. I found plenty of trustworthy sites along the way that all involved information on fitness and health. I also improved my creativity when it came to thinking up new ideas for prototype technologies for the future. I found out what things were most important when it came to being fit and healthy, and now I am going to think of some products that target all of these ideas, sort of like a fusion product that implements all the features of the technologies I spoke about in this blog into one. 

## Summary

Though this blog took a lot of time and research to finish, it also left me hopeful for our future blogs because I now have more knowledge on technology within my field. I can use the knowledge I gained from the research on this blog and use it for my next blog as I assume it is going to require a lot more research and creativity than this one, so I am going to need as much information and insight into my topic as I can get.
