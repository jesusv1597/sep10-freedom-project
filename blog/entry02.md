### What would be considered as Health and Fitness?

My topic could have many parts to it, for example. Health on its own could have many parts to it, there's mental health, physical health, emotional health, and a lot more. But I am going to focus more on the physical aspects of both health and fitness. Some good articles to introduce someone to these fitness aspects are the Web MD article ["Exercise and Weight Loss"](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/exercise-weight-control), as well as the American Heart Association article ["Why is physical activity so important for health and well-being?"](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/why-is-physical-activity-so-important-for-health-and-wellbeing)

### Software 

I spent a couple days researching some pieces of software that are related to health/fitness and these are some that I found that are really innovative and beneficial to the field.

### [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com)

The first piece of software I found that intrigued me is an app called **_MyFitnessPal_**. MyFitnessPal is an app that allows its user to do many things, a lot of these things being very beneficial when it comes to working out and being healthy. MyFitnessPal is mostly known for its ability to log user's food intake and to give it's users accurate nutritional facts about food, these are all health aspects but this app also has features that help with a user's fitness journey. The app also works as a journal for things like weight and stength progression so users can have a virtual place to log their journey.

### [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app)

I dug a little deeper into more softwares related to my topic and thats when I found the **_Nike Training Club_**. The Nike Training Club app is an app that is fairly similar to MyFItnessPal but with a few added features. the Nike Training Club App focuses on the training aspect of fitness and is really useful for finding workout suited to you. One of these features is the ability to connect with trainers online, these trainers are professionals at what they can guide out thoughout your entire fitness journey. The Trainers not only provide advice for working out, they also provide advice when it comes to nutrition as well, meaning you can have entire workout plans and meal plans made specifically for you.
