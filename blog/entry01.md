# Entry 1 Choosing my Topic (health/fitness)

### Choosing my Topic

The topic I decided to choose for my freedom project was health/fitness because it is something that I am pretty invested into on my own time, as I like being active and working out so it was something I would have passion for. This wasn't the only subject I considered choosing though as I considered hospital machinery and education as well, though I chose fitness as I think it is less connected to technology than the others, even though it could have many connections if you really think about it. I enjoyed researching technology's impact on education and on medical machinery, using articles like ["How Has Technology Changed Education"](https://online.purdue.edu/blog/education/how-has-technology-changed-education) by _Purdue University_ and ["What is healthcare technology"](https://www.ibm.com/topics/healthcare-technology). Both of these articles allowed me to really find out how technology was already implemented into these topics and how these innovations impacted these subjects. 

### Engineering Design Process

So far the only thing I've done in terms of my project is choosing the subject and doing a little bit of research into the technology, apart from that I am at the very beginning of my journey, the problem I am looking to solve is that not many people think about how technology could be used to stay fit and healthy. theres always this stereotype of technology being bad for your health as people often say that it causes people to stay inside more and to be less active. So I want to counter this stereotype by showing people that technology could be used to motivate people to workout and to stay fit.

### Skills

## Googling
I have advanced when it comes to googling as I am now able to search for only the things I need to find out, like for my freedom project I've found a way to google to where most of the time I will find only information regarding technology in a certain field. We learned about this in class with Mr. Mueller putting this information into our monday slides to help us remember terms we could use to find technologies impact on the subjects we chose.

## Notetaking
I have also advanced when it comes to taking notes, I now see the importance in writing important information down instead of just trying to simply memorize it. I've been trying to develop this skill ever since SEP has started so my notetaking skills will only increase as I continue writing in this blog, but for now I feel that I've increased in this field since we've started SEP.

### Next Steps
We have not been told our next steps but I am excited to find out what we're going to have to do next, personal next steps for me would be researching technology in fitness a little more and figuring out how to solve the problem of the stereotypes technology is subject to.
