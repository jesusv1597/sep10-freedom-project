### Choosing my Topic

THe topic I decided to choose for my freedom project was health/fitness because it is something that I am pretty invested into on my own time, as I like being active and working out so it was something I would have passion for. This wasn't the only subject I considered choosing though as I considered hospital machinery and education as well, though I chose fitness as I think it is less connected to technology, even though it could have many if you really think about it.
